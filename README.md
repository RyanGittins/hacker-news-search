Hacker News Search
==================

![hacker news search](http://ryangittins.com/img/hacker-news-search.png)

This simple, three-line userscript adds a search box to the top bar of the
[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) site.  While it may seem a bit
obscene to desecrate the iconic Hacker News title bar, it makes the site
significantly more usable.  The search box functions in exactly the same manner
as the often-forgotten one at the bottom of the page.  Just type your search
terms in the box and press enter!

While this script is only three lines of code, please feel free to comment,
suggest improvements, submit a pull request, fork the repo, or drop me a note!
